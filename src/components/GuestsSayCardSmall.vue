     "We had a great time at this location. Letâ€™s list: Pros: -Extremely clean. Hallways, rooms, pool, and lobby areas -Room was very modern and clean. Nicely decorated -Pool was a decent temperature for how hot it was! Bar staff, Spencer, Rick, Chuck, & BJ are a true asset to the Brightling Hotel brand. Honest, quick, and personable. My one and only con: There were no fresh make cookies left in the room at checking :). Other than that the Brightling Hotel was great. Thanks!"
