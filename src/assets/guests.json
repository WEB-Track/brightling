Nicely decorated -Pool was a decent temperature for how hot it was! Bar staff, Spencer, Rick, Chuck, & BJ are a true asset to the Brightling Hotel brand. Honest, quick, and personable. My one and only con: There were no fresh make cookies left in the room at checking :). Other than that the Brightling Hotel was great. Thanks!"

However, the food excellent and fair value. This is a hotel that has large banquet rooms which are beautiful. It is great for weddings and family gatherings. The overall atmosphere and staff are great!!!"
